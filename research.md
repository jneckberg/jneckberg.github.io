## Do insect herbivores affect the compensatory response of the rest of the plant community following dominant plant species loss? 

Since 2021 in an old field at Matthaei Botanical Garden in Ann Arbor, I, along with several University of Michigan undergraduates, have been studying the effect of the dominant plant species *Solidago canadensis* (Canada goldenrod) on the rest of the plant community and associated arthropods using a dominant species removal experiment. More recently, I have been interested in the combined and potentially interactive effects of *S. canadensis* and insect herbivores on plant community structure and ecosystem function. In particular, I quantified the independent and interactive effects of *S. canadensis* removal and insect reduction on soil microclimate, light availability, plant functional traits, plant species richness, the decomposition rate of soil organic matter, and productivity. Given that we maintained this field experiment over multiple growing seasons, I further investigated whether insect herbivores limit the compensatory response of remaining plant species following *S. canadensis* loss and whether *S. canadensis* and insects shape the temporal stability of plant richness and aboveground biomass.

## What are the combined and interactive effects of precipitation and insect herbivory on plant community structure and ecosystem function? 

At the University of Michigan Biological Station in Pellston, Michigan I have established a precipitation and insect herbivory manipulation experiment. In an old-field ecosystem, I constructed insect enclosures to control both the presence and density of insect herbivores. Above these enclosures, I constructed rainout shelters designed to intercept 40% of incoming precipitation to simulate future precipitation patterns in northern Michigan. With this experimental design, I test the combined and interactive effects of altered precipitation and insect herbivory on plant community composition, the community weighted mean of a suite of plant functional traits, functional diversity, and aboveground biomass.

## What are the effects of nitrogen fertilization, warming, and vertebrate grazing on plant functional traits across an altitudinal gradient in an alpine ecosystem?

As part of the Plant Functional Traits Course, I had the opportunity to work at the THREE-D experiment site in Aurland, Norway. In collaboration with researchers around the world, we developed a plant functional trait collection strategy that would allow us to quantify the effects of mammalian grazing, nitrogen addition, and warming on the community weighted mean of plant functional traits and plant functional diversity.
