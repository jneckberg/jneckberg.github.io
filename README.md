# About Me

![profile](howard_website_photo.jpg){: width="350px"}

I am a plant community ecologist and recently completed my PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Michigan in April 2025. My PhD work focused on the role of dominant plant species, insect herbivores, and global change in shaping terrestrial plant community structure and ecosystem function. I studied at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio for my undergraduate degree where I majored in Biology with a minor in History. As an undergraduate, I conducted research on the macroecology of North and South American bryophytes and the plasticity of plant defense, particularly cyanogenesis. If I'm not at work, I'm probably at the Ann Arbor District Library making some amateur art.
